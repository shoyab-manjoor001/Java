NotePoints:

Difference b/w collection and Stream.
Ans: Whenever we need to represent a group of objects as single entity then we use Collection and when we need to perform operation like filtering on the collection then we use Stream.

Difference b/w Filter and Map:

1. Filter in Stream uses Predicate (true/false) value whereas Map uses Funtion to perform operation. 
2. Filter is used when we need to do operation on selected values from a collection whereas Map is used when we have to perfrom operation on each object of collection.
